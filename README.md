# WebAssembly SDK
A toolkit for creating WebAssembly modules.

## Installing Wasdk

### Installing from NPM

```

### Installing from GitHub
This is recommended if you want to contribute to the wasdk project.

Clone this repository and run:
```
npm install
```

This downloads all necessary pre-compiled binaries for your operating system, which includes: Emscripten, Binaryen, SpiderMonkey, LLVM and Clang.

## Usage

Wasdk includes a variety of tools which accessible through the `wasdk` command:


### SDK Management

```
wasdk sdk --install
```


```
wasdk sdk --clean
```


### Viewing WebAssembly Compiled Machine Code

Use the `disassemble` command to view the compiled machine code for a WebAssembly program.
This code is generated by the ION compiler (used in the Firefox Web Browser). It should be
fairly similar to the code produced by other browser engines.

```
wasdk disassemble test/universe.wast
```

```
(module
  (export "answer" (func $answer))
  (func $answer (result i32)
    (return (i32.const 42))
  )
)
```
